*Complete the sections below to indicate what work you have completed. This will guide your marker. 
Your marker will leave a mark and feedback in this file.*

## 0. Practicals and Exercises

*Describe here the work that is in the ``practicals`` folder. Pay special attention
to any work you have included that is not taken from the sheets on MyBeckett. Write no more than 100 words.*

each folder contains python files named task1.py, task2.py... etc. each one corresponds to a task from that weeks
portfolio tasks. All portfolio tasks are completed and are fully functional. I am not aware of any errors or bugs.
Each python file contains a multi-line comment containing the task brief.

## 1. Task 1: Pizza Prices

*Explain here how your "Pizza" programs works. Is it complete? Do you know of some bugs or errors? Be honest!
Write about 100 words.*

My program loops there is a keyboard interrupt 'ctrl+c'. The loop asks for, and then validate inputs before telling the
user the price for their pizza. I have used multiple functions throughout my program to try and reduce nesting, making
my program easier to read. My program is fully functional, and I am not aware of any bugs or errors. This program takes
inputs directly so should be run in the command line with arguments.

## 2. Task 2: The Cat Shelter

*Does this program work correctly? Please confirm if the file name is taken as a command-line argument. IS there
anything else your marker needs to know?*

This program also uses multiple functions to reduce nesting in an aim to increase readability. It firstly tries to
open a file given as a command line argument, and tells the user the file cannot be opened if the file is not found,
once the file is opened the content is split into a list of lines and passed to a new function to be analysed. The
Program is fully functional, and I am not aware of any bugs or errors.

## 3. Task 3: Managing Passwords

*Please indicate how much of this is completed. If it is incomplete, how much has been done? What does the marker
need to do in order to see how much you have done?*

This task is fully functional, and I am not aware of any bugs or error. it uses a separate 'user_management.py' file
to store any functions that will be used throughout the programs. This file does not run. adduser.py, deluser.py,
login.py, and passwd.py all function as instructed taking the command-line arguments mentioned in the task. All
credentials get stored in the 'passwd.txt' file in the etc directory using a rot13 encryption.
